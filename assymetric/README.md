### Asymmetric Key Decryption using RSA

The following is a simple implementation of the RSA Key algorithm.
The encryption / decryption techniques showcased in these files are not for use in a real world scenario, but are instead intended for demonstration purposes.

To begin:
1. Run the getkey.py file

```bash
python3 get.py
```

2. Note down the generated public & private keys.
3. Run the encrypt.py file, use the generated public key

```bash
python3 encrypt.py
```

4. Note down the encrypted, cipher text.
5. Run the decrypt.py file, use the generated private key

```bash
python3 decrypt.py
```
