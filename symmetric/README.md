### Symmetric Key Encryption using Stream Ciphers

The following is a simple implementation of the Symmetric Key algorithm.
The encryption / decryption techniques showcased in these files are not for use in a real world scenario, but are instead intended for demonstration purposes.

To begin:
1. Run the encrypt.py file

```bash
python3 encrypt.py
```

2. Run the decrypt.py file

```bash
python3 decrypt.py
```
